  <h2>What is Live Poll?</h2>
  <ul class="accordion" data-accordion="">
    Live Poll is a digital quizzing and attendance tool that is free for students and faculty.  It integrates seamlessly with Canvas for any FIU course and can geofence polling to any location on campus.  Live Poll allows faculty to give both formative and summative assessments with many answer formats available, such as multiple-choice, essay, file upload, matching, heat map, word cloud, multiple-answer, numerical, string and more.
    <br> <br>


    Live Poll for Canvas is a homegrown innovation developed by FIU faculty, based upon an adaptation of Live Poll from the open-source platform IMathAS.
    <br> <br>



<h3>How to use Live Poll (for instructors)</h3>
<ul class="accordion" data-accordion="">

        <div class="content" id="panel-1-1">

          <ul>
           <li>An IMathAS instructor account is required to use Live Poll.  The account is always free.  If you already have an instructor account, do not set up another one, just simply log in here, as usual: <a href="https://imathas.fiu.edu/">IMathAS Instructor Login</a> <br> <br> </li>
           <li>If you forgot your password or want to reset it, go here: <a href="https://imathas.fiu.edu/forms.php?action=resetpw">Password Reset</a> <br> <br> </li>
           <li>If you forgot your username, then look it up here: <a href="https://imathas.fiu.edu/forms.php?action=lookupusername">Username Lookup</a> <br> <br> </li>
           <li>To establish your instructor account for the first time, make a request here: <a href="https://imathas.fiu.edu/newinstructor.php">Instructor Account Request</a> It takes up to 24 hours for your request to be approved; at the time of approval you will receive a confirmation email sent to the email address you provided.<br> </li>

           <i> Click on the above video to watch a step-by-step view of the below sequence of instructions.</i> <br> <br>
           <li>After signing into IMathAS here: <a href="https://imathas.fiu.edu/">IMathAS Instructor Login</a> scroll down and click on "Add New Course":   <br>
           <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/Setting up course pic 1.png" alt="sample picture"> <br> <br> </li>
           <li>You must create a separate IMathAS course for each section you teach. <br> <br> </li>
           <li>Select “Copy from my, a colleague's, or template course” , then select “Template Courses” followed by selecting “Live Poll SHELL”:  <br>
           <i>Note: This method is very useful as it guarantees Live Poll Sync is set up and does not need to be modified. </i> <br>
           <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/Setting up course Copy template pic.png" alt="sample picture" > <br> <br> </li>
           <li>Make a unique course name, specific to your course.  Avoid verbatim use of a course name that already exists.  Leave the "Enrollment key" box empty, it will never be needed: <br>
           <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/Setting up course name of course pic.png" alt="sample picture" > <br> <br> </li>
           <li>Before hitting the "Submit" button, you have several feature types to expand and adjust at the bottom of the screen.  Be careful, as usually the default options are the ones wanted. <br> <br> </li>
           <li>After hitting the "Submit" button, you are returned back to the main page where you will find the "Live Poll Sync" assessment and under its toggle gear you select "Settings".  Do not change any settings, with the possible exception of "Participation Weight" under the "Grading and Feedback" tab at the bottom of the page. <br> <br>
               You have to make a decision for the whole course on how much of the grade for a question you want to come from the student simply participating.  Here is an example setting, namely the slider positioned so that all students get 80% on a question for attempting it, without ever answering it correctly, no matter how many attempt(s) they are allowed on it. <br> </li>

          <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NkDhu38YcR5V1cV4Tclp8Qh-CIXjpRKf/preview" width="640" height="356"></iframe> <br>
          <i> Click on the above video to watch a step-by-step view of the below sequence of instructions.</i> <br> <br>
          You will need to install two different links in Canvas in order to get Live Poll up and running. <br> <br>
         <ol Type="1">
          First Step: To start, you will need to set up the actual Live Poll. <br>
         <li>	Go to your course in Canvas and click on "Modules" on the left: <br>
         <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/Connecting live poll pic1.png" alt="sample picture"> <br> <br> </li>
         <li> Find the Module marked “Student Resources" and click the arrow to expand it, and then click on the "+" sign: <br>
         <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/Connecting live poll pic2.png" alt="sample picture"> <br> <br> </li>
         <li> From the dropdown menu select "Add External Tool", and then scroll down and choose "IMathAS", then click on "Add Item": <br>
         <i> Note: If the scroll feature does not work for your browser, then copy and paste this directly in the URL box instead: https://imathas.fiu.edu/bltilaunch.php For the "Page Name" box enter "IMathAS".</i> <br>
         <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/Connecting live poll pic3 fixed.png" alt="sample picture"> <br> <br> </li>
         <li> You should now see IMathAS in the module.  Click the three dots to the right of IMathAS and choose "Edit": <br>
         <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/Connecting live poll pic6 fixed.png" alt="sample picture"> <br> <br> </li>
         <li> Change the title to "Live Poll" and click "Update": <br>
         <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/Connecting Live Poll pic5.png" alt="sample picture"> <br> <br> </li>
         <li> Click on the little "No Solution" symbol to publish: <br>
         <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/Connecting Live Poll pic 6 fixed.png" alt="sample picture"> <br> <br> </li>
         </ol>
         <ol Type="1">
         Second Step: Next, you will need to set up the link that will allow the grades to sync from IMathAS to Canvas.  Once this is set up, you will not need to touch it the rest of the semester.  Your students will need to click on this link only once in order to activate their grade sync. <br> <br>
         <li>	Go to your course in Canvas and click on "Assignments" on the left: <br>
         <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/Connecting Course Live Poll pic 7.png" alt="sample picture"> <br> <br> </li>
         <li>Click on “+ Assignment“: <br>
         <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/Connecting course Live Poll pic 8.png" alt="sample picture"> <br> <br> </li>

         a.	Set the Assignment Name to “Live Poll Sync” and then set the Points to 100: <br>
         <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/Connecting course Live Poll pic 9.png" alt="sample picture"> <br> <br>

         b.	Set Submission Type to "External Tool", then on the next screen here click on "Find", select “IMathAS” and click on "Select": <br>
         <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/Connecting course Live Poll pic7 10a.png" alt="sample picture"> <br> <br>
         c.	Click on "Save & Publish". <br> <br>


         <li> Once you have done this, you will see a prompt asking you to log into your instructor IMathAS account.  You will only need to do this once. This will link your Canvas account with your IMathAS account. <br> <br> </li>
         <li> On the next page, slect "Change Course Link": <br>
         <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/Connecting course Live Poll pic 11.png" alt="sample picture"> <br> <br> </li>
         <li> Next, from the "Link Resource" screen select the "Live Poll Sync" assessment from the drop-down menu followed by clicking "Make Placement": <br>
         <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/Connecting course Live Poll pic 13.png" alt="sample picture"> <br> <br> </li>
         <li>	If everything is configured properly, you will see a screen similar to below. Note that the Canvas placement for Live Poll Sync is in assignments as shown here: <br>
         <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/connecting fixed live poll sync pic.jpeg" alt="sample picture"> <br> <br> </li>
         Finally click on "Modules" in the left-column, scroll down to the module where you want the insert the "Live Poll Sync" button for students. <br> <br>
         <i >Note: Putting it within a module that is different from the module that contains "Live Poll" is a decision you get to make.  Students attempting to enter a Live Poll assessment during class may mistakenly think they should access it via "Live Poll Sync", which will never display the assessment questions. </i> <br> <br>
         Click on "+ assignment" to the right of the module you want and  Select “Live Poll Sync” from the list and click on “Add Item” <br>
         </ol>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions (for instructors)</h3>
<ul class="accordion" data-accordion="">
    <li class="accordion-navigation"><a class="accordion-link" href="#panel-2-1" aria-expanded="false">What devices and browsers should my students use for Live Poll?</a>
        <div class="content" id="panel-2-1">
           Live Poll can be used on a laptop, desktop, Chromebook, tablet, iPad, and smartphone.  It works well on all browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.  In addition, the Canvas app is an option for smartphones and tablets.  Basically, any hardware/software choices that will let students do work in their Canvas course already, will continue to work successfully when they do Live Poll.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li class="accordion-navigation"><a class="accordion-link" href="#panel-2-2" aria-expanded="false">Should students on smartphones and tablets use the Canvas Student app or a web browser? </a>
        <div class="content" id="panel-2-2">
          Either will work fine.  The slight advantage of the Canvas Student app is that is logged in all the time, so students have faster access.  Live Poll is easier to use with the app.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li class="accordion-navigation"><a class="accordion-link" href="#panel-2-3" aria-expanded="false">Should student smartphones use cellular data or FIU WiFi?</a>
        <div class="content" id="panel-2-3">
          Either will work fine, in principle.  Students should connect to FIU_SECUREWiFi over FIU_WiFi, even if FIU_WiFi may work fine.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li class="accordion-navigation"><a class="accordion-link" href="#panel-2-4" aria-expanded="false">How can I make the questions and answers reviewable to students after class?</a>
        <div class="content" id="panel-2-4">
          Adjust the settings at the assessment level to accomplish this.  As long as the assessment is available and the answers are open to review in the gradebook it will work, as shown here, under the "Settings" selection for the specific assessment:
          <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/FAQ Review Answer pic fixed.png" alt="sample picture" >
          Instruct students to click on "Live Poll Sync" to see the questions, answers, and moreover their actual responses to the items that compose the assessment.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li class="accordion-navigation"><a class="accordion-link" href="#panel-2-5" aria-expanded="false">I have a student who claims the posted Live Poll grade in Canvas is incorrect.  What can I do to check?</a>
        <div class="content" id="panel-2-5">
          You should log into IMathAS here <a href="https://imathas.fiu.edu/">IMathAS Instructor Login</a> then select the course the student is in, followed by clicking on gradebook in the left-column.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li class="accordion-navigation"><a class="accordion-link" href="#panel-2-6" aria-expanded="false">I have a multi-question Live Poll assessment, and I only did some, but not all of the questions during class. Should I delete the unused ones?</a>
      <div class="content" id="panel-2-6">
       It is recommended that you leave them alone, unless you think it will reduce student confusion.  The unused questions have no effect on the grade generated for the assessment, so withdrawing them is not needed. <br>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="accordion-navigation"><a class="accordion-link" href="#panel-2-7" aria-expanded="false">How can the answering of Live Poll questions be restricted to only the students who are physically present in class?</a>
      <div class="content" id="panel-2-7">
      Adjust the settings at the assessment level to accomplish this.  Under the  "Settings" selection, first ensure you are in the "Simple View" as shown here: <br>
      <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/FAQ Geofencing pic 1.png" alt="sample picture" > <br>
      Then, at the bottom of the screen you have four options under the drop-down box. <br>
      <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/FAQ Geofencing pic 2.png" alt="sample picture" > <br>
      Only the "Custom Location" option will allow you to move the blue center marker and adjust the radius.  Here is what geofencing to PG6 looks like: <br>
      <img class="livepollimg" src="./img/FAQ Geofencing pic 3.png" alt="sample picture" > <br>
      <i> Note: Geofencing does not work necessarily for students on a laptop, so consider directing any such students in your class to switch and use their smartphone for these questions.    </i>

    </li>
    <li class="accordion-navigation"><a class="accordion-link" href="#panel-2-8" aria-expanded="false">How can I change the participation-correctness grade ratio after an assessment is already over?</a>
      <div class="content" id="panel-2-8">
        This ratio can only be adjusted at a course level, which affects all Live Poll assessments.  Go into the "Live Poll Sync" assessment in your IMathAS course. Click on "Settings", scroll down and under "Grading and Feedback" adjust the slider as desired and then save.  The grades will update automatically after the next time you run Live Poll in class.  To update sooner, simply go into your Canvas course and click on "Live Poll Sync" followed by clicking on the button called "Initiate Grade Sync", the grades will be updated within 5 minutes. <br>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="accordion-navigation"><a class="accordion-link" href="#panel-2-9" aria-expanded="false">What are all the different questions types besides multiple-choice that I can use?</a>
      <div class="content" id="panel-2-9">
        Questions can have the following answer formats: Number, Calculated, Multiple-Choice, Multiple-Answer, Matching, Function, String, Essay, Drawing, N-Tuple, Calculated N-Tuple, Complex, Calculated Complex, Numerical Matrix, Calculated Matrix, Interval, Calculated Interval, File Upload, Multipart. <br> <br>

      <div class="content" id="panel-2-10">
        Yes, Live Poll Sync must be added by you in Canvas if you want the assessments you run to count for any sort of student grade, even for participation.  Students need to click on the Live Poll Sync link in Canvas only once during the course.  As soon as they do that their Live Poll grades will sync to the canvas gradebook, including any assessments they answered before clicking the button. <br>
